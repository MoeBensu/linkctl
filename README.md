# URL Shortener

## A Brief Description
Just another [url shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening) service, using MERN stack.

A minimal service in terms of styling, yet relies on clean and scalable code.

## Used Technologies
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - database
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js web framework
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - a client-side JavaScript library/framework
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript application backend server
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - web server (will be added to repo when deployed)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)/[react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - CSS Framework(s)

## Upcoming plans
There're certainly some enhancements still to be done, i.e. moving url validation to client-side, and deployment will also follow on as soon as I have more time. I would probably go with a dedicated server and containerize the app or maybe try out AWS.

Feedback is more than welcome. Tx in advance ;)
